In some ways this lab was easier than the last lab now that I have experience using RazorPages, but it was certainly more complicated than lab 7.

For the most part, the tutorial was pretty easy, and I had little to no trouble completing it. The most difficult parts were updating the pages to include student ages, more grades, etc. Working with multiple table was interesting (keeping track of what pages were being edited, making changes to specific pages for each table).

I feel more confident about my abilities to create a webpage/database for the final project after completing this lab.
