Our group has made significant progress on implementing the site and database and had a lot to show our client at the third meeting.

Personally, my role in the project is evolving from designing/planning the pages for the site/database to actually contributing to the implementation of the pages on the site. I contributed to the design of the page we demonstrated to our client and some of the pages we have yet to implement.

Moving forward, I will continue to contribute to the implementation of the pages on the site, specifically the design/layout of some of the pages and creation/editing of CSS files.
