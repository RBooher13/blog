I particularly enjoyed this lab. It was interesting to see the things we've learned so far come together onto one platform.

The tutorial was pretty easy and I had very few issues completing it. It was a little more difficult to complete my own application as I had to create my own data model with different parameters. The RazorPages framework was similar to the Jekyll framework (specifically in the types of files and how they connected with each other), but it was different in some ways (the inclusion of C# code and the generation of a local host).

I feel reasonably confident in my ability to make another Razor application and look forward to the next opportunity to do so.
