This project required a special set of skills and talents to complete and I think will succeed in bringing about some form of social change in the area.

Aside from the programming and web development skills this project required, it also allowed us to develop our communication skills with our client and with members of our team. Effective communication was important in assessing what it was our client wanted and conveying to them how it would be done. Communication within our team was also important in assigning specific roles to each member and making sure every aspect of the project was completed effectively. Ultimately, I think I think I gained valuable experience both in web/database development and client communication/group collaboration.

The social change this project brings about won't be particularly large-scale, but we will have succeeded in assisting a local business in becoming more efficient. Conceivably our contributions will have some sort of noticeable change in the way deliveries are processed/organized at Porch Swing Farms and have positive effects on the people who receive orders from them.
