So far, I think that our work on this project is going well. We've made sufficient progress on our plans for the database, and we feel confident that we can implement them how we want. Personally, my work on the project so far has consisted of helping design our schema and putting together the Moqups for the website/database. I, unfortunately wasn't able to attend the second meeting with our client, but I was familiar with what was being shared with her, and I reviewed the feedback she gave us afterwards. Moving forward with our project, I will contribute to the final implementation of the website/database by designing/creating some of the pages on it using Visual Studio.
