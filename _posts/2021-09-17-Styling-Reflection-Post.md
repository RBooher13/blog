Though this is my first time creating and styling a blog like this, the steps in this lab felt a little more familiar since I've had more experience with [Markdown] [Markdown] and [HTML] [HTML].

I intially had some trouble finding the correct post.html and header.html files for the minima style, but eventually I was able to locate them and copy them to my directory. I'm looking forward to adding more pages to this blog and writing more posts in Markdown.
