A lot of the process of setting up this blog was new to me. I had had some experience creating and cloning a repository on [GitHub] [GitHub], but there were some steps in the process that were somewhat, if not, entirely, new to me, including:
* Using the computer terminal.
* Setting up a local server.
* Writing a Markdown file.

Writing in the terminal was the most difficult part for me, but writing the Markdown file came pretty easily. I'm most looking forward to learning more about Jekyll and writing more code using [Markdown] [Markdown].
